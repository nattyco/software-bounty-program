# Software Bounty Program

We are running a bounty program to complete the projected functionality as soon as possible. Currently bounties are not paid in cash, but in Fermat tokens. This is one of the ways we use to distribute ownership of the project with whoever adds value to it. 

## Sign-up - License Agreement - (READ FIRST)
Anyone who adds value to the Project in any form needs to sign up a Contribution License Agreement as the first step to become part of the project. To do that, please follow the steps described [here](https://github.com/bitDubai/contribution-program/tree/master/license-agreements/README.md) 

Now, after signing up,  you can follow the Bounty program procedure below.

## Procedure

1. Grab a Team and apply for one of the projects listed whose status reads as _Not Assigned_ (if you are already a member of the bitDubai network you can only participate on the projects you are assigned to, if it happens that that project has a bounty then you are automatically participating on the bounty-program together with the team that is working on that.)
2. Create an Issue in this REPO tagging the @bounty-program-team asking to assign to your team the project you are interested in.
3. Someone on this team will evaluate your skills and may or may not assign the project to your team. In any case a complete explanation of the reasons why they do or don't assign it will be given to you. Everything will happen in the disscussion on the issue created.
4. The exact scope of the project is defined once the project is assigned to a team. It is agreed between the team members and the @bounty-program-team.

## Rules

1. If you miss the target month for any reason you can still be awarded half of the bounty if you reach the targe phase the following month.
2. A team has to maintain the code implemented during the first 3 months in production. 
3. The team will be awarded a 10% extra of the bounty received for each of these 3 months.
4. The distribution of the bounty between the team members is free. It is up to the team to decide how to distribute the bounty between them or other people from other teams that helped.
5. Team leaders can make agreements for tokens of the possible bounty with other team leaders to help them with the project. In fact this is expected to happend with graphic designers, UX designers, copywriters and others, in order to secure their commitment to the project for certain dates.
6. Reaching production phase means passing all controls, checks and approvals that might be in place by the time the code is implemented. Those approval procedures might or might not be in place at present time.
7. The conditions of bounties that are not yet _Assigned_ might be changed at anytime by the @bounty-program-team. Once assigned, the conditions will stay fixed.
8. If the @bounty-program-team sees a lack of commitment of a team with the project assigned or a the progress is too slow, it might cancel the assigment and return the project to the pool of _Not Assigned_ bounties.
9. Some projects might require a collateral in fermat tokens provided by the team members. These tokens will be held as a deposit during the period the team is working for the bounty. If they fail to win the bounty the collateral will be lost.
10. A short _agreement_ will be added to the _agreements_ folder in this repo with the conditions agreed by the team and the @bounty-program-team.
11. The same _agreement_ document will be updated once the bounty is won with a distribution table where all beneficiaries will be listed together with the percentage that they will receive.
12. 11. At a DEMO-DAY the team showcases the functionality that has developed and a jury decides if the bounty should be awarded or not.
13. The payment of the bounty will be done when the project is released to general public (production). The amount of Tokens to receive will be calculated at the Tokens price at the date the project is relesed to the public.
14. The bounty awarded expires after 30 days of the DEMO day if the project has not been released.
15. A Team cannot participate on other bounty of this program until the current one they are working at is released (production).
16. Team members cannot leave the team for other teams before the project reaches production phase. The only way to leave is leaving the Fermat project.
